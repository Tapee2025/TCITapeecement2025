-- Drop all existing policies on rewards table to start fresh
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view available rewards" ON rewards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all rewards" ON rewards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can manage rewards" ON rewards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view available rewards" ON rewards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage rewards" ON rewards;

-- Create simplified and working policies

-- Policy 1: Allow all authenticated users to read available rewards
CREATE POLICY "Allow reading available rewards"
  ON rewards
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (available = true);

-- Policy 2: Allow admins to do everything with rewards
CREATE POLICY "Allow admin full access to rewards"
  ON rewards
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM users
      WHERE users.id = auth.uid()
      AND users.role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Policy 3: Allow service role full access (for system operations)
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role full access to rewards"
  ON rewards
  FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true);

-- Ensure the rewards table has all necessary columns with proper defaults
ALTER TABLE rewards 
ALTER COLUMN visible_to SET DEFAULT ARRAY['builder', 'contractor'];

-- Add any missing indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rewards_available ON rewards(available);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rewards_expiry ON rewards(expiry_date);
